# Weather-Dashboard

This application was created for users to search for current and upcoming weather conditions using a third party API. When the user searches for weather they will be presented with a daily result with the date, an icon showing weather conditions, the current temperature, the wind speed and the UV index. A five day forecast will also display on the site below the daily showing the icon for the weather condtions, the temperature, wind speed, and the humidity for the days. When the user searches for cities or by zip codes buttons will be generated that will allow the user to click and be take to previous search history results.
